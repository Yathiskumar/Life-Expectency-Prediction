Life Expectancy Prediction
Overview
This Python script utilizes machine learning to predict life expectancy based on various features. It preprocesses data, trains Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models, evaluates their performance, and predicts life expectancy for new input features.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Usage
Install Jupyter Notebook: pip install notebook
Open Jupyter Notebook: jupyter notebook
Navigate to the script file (Life_Expectancy_Prediction.ipynb) and run the cells.
Content
Data Exploration: Analyze and visualize life expectancy data.
Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.
Model Training: Train Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.
Prediction: Predict life expectancy for new input features.
Notes
Ensure all required libraries are installed (numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn).
This script is designed to be run in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to enhance your understanding and further improve life expectancy predictions.
